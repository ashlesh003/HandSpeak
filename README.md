# HandSpeak
Hand Speak 👋 – Sign Language Recognition is a system designed to bridge the communication gap between the hearing and deaf-mute communities using computer vision and deep learning. The system captures hand gestures through a camera, processes them with machine learning algorithms, and converts them into real-time text output. 🖐️

# 🎯 Objectives:
 • Build an accurate sign language recognition system using state-of-the-art AI technologies.
 • Achieve real-time processing with minimal delay to ensure natural conversations.
 • Develop a scalable solution capable of handling a wide range of sign gestures.
 • Create a user-friendly web interface to make the system easily accessible to all users.

# 🛠️ Proposed Methodology:
<ul>
  <li><b>Capturing Hand Gestures:</b></li>
A webcam or external camera captures live video of hand movements.
  <li><b>Preprocessing Image Frames:</b></li>
The frames undergo operations like resizing, noise reduction, and color correction to enhance clarity and improve model performance.
  <li><b>Feature Extraction:</b></li>
Using advanced computer vision tools like OpenCV and MediaPipe, the system extracts key hand landmarks (finger positions, palm orientation, etc.).
  <li><b>Gesture Classification:</b></li>
A deep learning model, based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), classifies each gesture.
  <li><b>Text Output Generation:</b></li>
The recognized gestures are mapped to corresponding words or phrases and instantly displayed as text output, enabling real-time communication.
